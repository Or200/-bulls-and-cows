# Bulls & Cows

Players: Two - Also known as: number Mastermind

Players take turns in trying to guess each other's number.
Description

One player, the Chooser, thinks of a four-number number and the other player, the Guesser, tries to guess it.

At each turn the Guesser tries a four-number number, and the Chooser says how close it is to the answer by giving:

    The number of Bulls - numbers correct in the right position.
    The number of Cows - numbers correct but in the wrong position.

The Guesser tries to guess the answer in the fewest number of turns.

If either number has repeated numbers the rule is that each number can only count towards the score once, and Bulls are counted before Cows.
